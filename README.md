# Life of a Hamster
##At birth hamsters are very vulnerable as they are blind and deaf and they don’t have any fur. A hamster’s fur only starts to appear when it is approximately five days old and their eyes don’t start to open until they are two weeks old.

##Once their eyes are open, they grow more independent in their exploration. However, they continue to be reared by their mother until they are between 21 and 28 days old.

##This is when it’s very important for hamsters to be removed from their mother’s care and, in the case of Syrian hamsters, separated to live as individuals. 

It has to be done with **outmost haste**, for it is known that syrian hamsters tend to go in a frenzied state past that point in time, developping cringy *cannibalistic* tendencies that do not die off until only one is left standing .
