# Life of a Hamster
##At birth hamsters are very vulnerable as they are blind and deaf and they don’t have any fur. A hamster’s fur only starts to appear when it is approximately five days old and their eyes don’t start to open until they are two weeks old.

##Once their eyes are open, they grow more independent in their exploration. However, they continue to be reared by their mother until they are between 21 and 28 days old.

##This is when it’s very important for hamsters to be removed from their mother’s care and, in the case of Syrian hamsters, separated to live as individuals. 

<<<<<<< HEAD
*Hamsters* like to play with balls and run around. They are **friendly**, **fun** and **chill** at the same time. When it's cold, you can pet them to warm yourself a bit... **Brrr**!

=======
Syrians hamsters are also known to develop *cannibalistic* tendencies sometimes when the youngs stay for too long with their mothers.

Hamsters especially have the particularity of having expandable pockets inside the cheeks, called mazes

With their big chick, they can **chew away** their cage.
This is where the problem is starting.
