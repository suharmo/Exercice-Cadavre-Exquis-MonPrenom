# Life of a Hamster
##At birth hamsters are very vulnerable as they are blind and deaf and they don’t have any fur. A hamster’s fur only starts to appear when it is approximately five days old and their eyes don’t start to open until they are two weeks old.

##Once their eyes are open, they grow more independent in their exploration. However, they continue to be reared by their mother until they are between 21 and 28 days old.

##This is when it’s very important for hamsters to be removed from their mother’s care and, in the case of Syrian hamsters, separated to live as individuals.

*Hamsters* like to play with balls and run around. They are **friendly**, **fun** and **chill** at the same time. When it's cold, you can pet them to warm yourself a bit... **Brrr**!

=======
Syrians hamsters are also known to develop *cannibalistic* tendencies sometimes when the youngs stay for too long with their mothers.

Hamsters especially have the particularity of having expandable pockets inside the cheeks, called mazes
